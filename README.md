# 📚 Book Finder

**Book Finder** is a full-stack web application that allows users to **search, explore, and view book details** using the **Google Books API**.  
The system is built with a **Flask backend** and a **React (Vite)** frontend - designed for **clarity, performance, and modern UX**.

---

##  Overview

Book Finder provides a seamless book search experience:
- Secure user authentication with Firebase.
- Real-time search powered by Google Books.
- Modern, adaptive UI built with Material UI (MUI) and refined custom CSS styling.
- Smooth animations, consistent theming, and accessibility in design.

##  System Architecture

Below is a summary of the main technologies and their roles:


| Layer             | Technology                                 | Description                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Backend (API)** | Flask, Flask-CORS, Flask-Limiter, Requests | RESTful API integrating with Google Books, includes caching and rate limiting. |
| **Frontend (UI)** | React (Vite), Material UI, Axios           | Search interface with authentication and animated components.                  |
| **Testing**       | Pytest, unittest.mock                      | Automated unit and integration tests.                                          |
| **API**           | Google Books API                           | External data source for book search and details.                              |

##  Core Features

### 🔹 Backend
- **Google Books API integration** - retrieves and normalizes book data (title, authors, cover, description).
- **Caching layer** - reduces repeated external API calls with TTL-based caching.
- **Rate limiting** - IP-based throttling to prevent abuse.
- **Structured error handling** - centralized error responses with user-friendly messages.
- **Clean architecture** - separated into `core`, `services`, and `routers` for maintainability.
- **Unit and integration tests** - implemented using `pytest` and mocks.

### 🔹 Frontend
- **Authentication (Firebase)** - Sign up, Sign in, Password reset.
- **Protected routes** - User must be authenticated to access main pages.
- **Search experience** - Query books by title, author, or keyword.
- **Adaptive layout** - Optimized for desktop and medium screen sizes.
- **Custom MUI theme** - Consistent color palette, typography, spacing, and hover effects.
- **Refined UI details** - Subtle shadows, transitions, glassmorphism effects, and smooth interactions.

---

##  Design & Theme

The interface is built with **Material UI (MUI)** as the foundation, combined with **custom CSS** for visual refinement and micro-interactions.  
The design focuses on simplicity, clarity, and consistency across all components.

Core UI behaviors such as hover transitions, blur effects, and adaptive layouts are implemented through a blend of **MUI theming** and **custom CSS styling**, maintaining a clean, modern appearance while ensuring accessibility and usability.

##  Authentication Flow

1. **User signs up** with name, email, and password → handled via Firebase Auth SDK.  
2. **Session persistence** (`browserLocalPersistence`) ensures users remain logged in after refresh.  
3. **Protected routes** automatically redirect unauthenticated users to `/signin`.  
4. **Forgot password** allows email-based password reset with built-in Firebase support.

---

##  Search Flow

1. User types a query in the **hero search bar**.  
2. Request sent via Axios to Flask endpoint `/api/books/search?q=...`.  
3. Flask calls Google Books API, normalizes response, and caches it.  
4. React Query updates state and re-renders results table.  
5. Clicking a book opens a **Book Details page**, with description, author, and cover image.

---

##  API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `/health` | GET | Server health check |
| `/api/books/search?q=python` | GET | Search books by keyword |
| `/api/books/<id>` | GET | Fetch book details by ID |

## Testing

Run backend tests with:

```bash
pytest -v
```

**Tests include:**

* Unit tests for caching, Google Books services, and data serialization.
* Integration tests for Flask routes using a test client fixture.
* Mocked external API calls for isolated, reliable testing.

Configuration is managed via `pytest.ini` for verbosity and path setup.

Example output on success:

```
tests/test_books.py::test_clean_description_removes_html PASSED
tests/test_books.py::test_search_books_returns_serialized PASSED
tests/test_routes.py::test_health_endpoint PASSED
tests/test_routes.py::test_search_books_endpoint PASSED
```

All tests pass successfully ✅

It was fully deployed and tested in a cloud environment, and later taken offline to **optimize resource usage** after the evaluation phase.  
The project remains **fully functional locally** — see the “Getting Started” section below for setup instructions.


---
